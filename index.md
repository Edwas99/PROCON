## Machine Learning project PROCON

### By Edwin Friberg | JAN 5 2022 | 10 min read  

This is a project in the course TNM108 at Linköping University. The name PROCON comes from the main idea of the project, to create PROS & CONS lists based on customer reviews.
The idea is to give the user a good overview of a product based on what other people think without having to read through an ocean of good and bad reviews. I think that well-written reviews can give good insights into a product. An example where reviews can be helpful is when a product has fantastic specs but if you read the reviews about the product, you get to know that it has a lot of bugs and the specs don't matter because of this. Without further explanation, let's dive into how I tried to do this:

### The dataset:
The project could be applied to any product since you can create a PROS&CONS list for anything, however, I decided to work with phones in this project. I choose to work with mobile phones because I found a suitable dataset on Kaggle with Amazon reviews of a lot of phones. The dataset contained two files, one file containing the items (721 phones) and one file which contained 68 000 different reviews for these phones. For more details about the dataset, see [Amazon Cellphone Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/grikomsn/amazon-cell-phones-reviews/code).


```python

#import the datasets
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
reviews=pd.read_csv("20191226-reviews.csv", encoding='utf-8')
print(reviews.info())
items=pd.read_csv("20191226-items.csv", encoding="utf-8")
print(items.info())

```
So this is what the two datsets contained:

### Dataset merging and feature extraction
To be easier to work with, I merged the datasets, changed some names that were the same, dropped some unnecessary columns, and changed the Amazon product code to a number using labelEncoder.
```python
#Merging and cleaning the datasets
reviews.rename(columns={'rating': 'review_rating'},
          inplace=True, errors='raise')


#changing the amazon product code to a number
labelEncoder = LabelEncoder()
labelEncoder.fit(reviews['asin'])
reviews = pd.merge(reviews, items, how="left", left_on="asin", right_on="asin")
reviews.drop(['name', 'date', 'image'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
reviews['asin'] = labelEncoder.transform(reviews['asin'])
print(reviews.info())
```
This resulted in the following dataset

### New features, Positivity and Helpful
After this, two new features were created. One that told us if a review was helpful by checking how many helpful votes it had. The other feature checked if the review was positive or not, depending on the number of stars that the review had.

```python
#Creating two new features, positivity and helpful
reviews["positivity"] = reviews["review_rating"].apply(lambda x: 1 if x>3 else(0 if x==3 else -1))
reviews["helpful"] = reviews["helpfulVotes"].apply(lambda x: 2 if x>10 else(1 if x>5 else 0))
print(reviews.sort_values(by=["totalReviews"]) )
```
This gave us an easy way to see if a review was positive or negative and how helpful people thought it was. The helpful feature also helps us find good written reviews.

### Search for a product, Vectorization and Classification 
The next step was to give the "user" a possibility to search for a phone or in a more general case search for a product. In the code, it was mostly implemented to give an idea of how the program works, but if the program would be implemented on a website or an app, this would be the search function. When using the search function it would be suggested to the user to give all necessary info like brand, model, special edition, and color. An example of this is if the user searches for "iPhone 13 pro max 256 GB gold", the possibility for the program to find the right product is much higher than compared to if the user only searches for "iPhone" or "iPhone 256 GB". To make the search function I vectorized all the titles and the searched phone, then I used SGDClassifier (SVM) to classify the searched phone. I tried to look for the right phone using cos similarity as well, this often resulted in the same phone as the classifier.

```python
# Vectorize the titles
docs_train, docs_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(reviews['title_y'], reviews["asin"], test_size = 0.20, random_state = 12)
vectorizer= CountVectorizer(min_df=2, tokenizer=nltk.word_tokenize, max_features=3000)
reviews_counts = vectorizer.fit_transform(docs_train)

Tfmer = TfidfTransformer()
reviews_tfidf = Tfmer.fit_transform(reviews_counts)

searched_phone = [
    'Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ Plus Factory Unlocked Cell Phone with 512GB (U.S. Warranty)',
 ]  

phone_vector=vectorizer.transform(searched_phone)
phone_tfidf=Tfmer.transform(phone_vector)

#Classify the searched phone using SVM
clf = SGDClassifier(loss='hinge', penalty='l2',alpha=1e-3, random_state=42
,max_iter=5, tol=None)

clf.fit(reviews_tfidf,y_train)

docs_test_counts = vectorizer.transform(docs_test)
docs_test_tfidf = Tfmer.transform(docs_test_counts)

y_pred = clf.predict(docs_test_tfidf)
#print(sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
pred = clf.predict(phone_tfidf)

#Check cos similarity aswell
cos_similarity = cosine_similarity(reviews_tfidf, phone_tfidf[0])
index_max = max(range(len(cos_similarity)), key=cos_similarity.__getitem__)
```

I got over 92 percent correct when classifying this way, but this was when testing with the same data but split up. So When a real user search for "iPhone 8" The program has a hard time knowing which iPhone it is and can many times take the wrong phone. To get the phone that we want, we have to be very specific and type it similarly to what the title is on the Amazon page.

### Using the features helpful and positivity
After this the most helpful reviews for the phone that were searched for are fetched and split into positive and negative ones, this is done by using the features we added earlier (helpful and positivity).

```python
#Getting the reviews fo the searched phone (pred)
reviews = reviews[reviews["asin"]==pred[0]].sort_values(by=["helpfulVotes"])

#getting the most helpfull reviews:
helpful_reviews=reviews[reviews["helpful"]==2].sort_values(by=["asin"])

#splitting the data up in positive and negative.
positive_reviews=helpful_reviews[helpful_reviews["positivity"]==1].sort_values(by=["helpfulVotes"])
negative_reviews = helpful_reviews[helpful_reviews["positivity"]==-1].sort_values(by=["helpfulVotes"])

```

The series of positive and negative reviews were then converted into text.

```python
#making the series of reviews to text
def make_fluent_text(serie):
    pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None)
    return " ".join(serie.to_string().split())

#positive reviews
pos_out=make_fluent_text(positive_reviews['body'])

#negative reviews
neg_out=make_fluent_text(negative_reviews['body'])

```
### Text processing and word frequency 
Two new functions were then created to clean the text and to calculate the word frequency.
```python
#Clean the text and delete stopwords and keywords
stop = set(stopwords.words('english'))
punc = set(string.punctuation)
keywords1 = reviews["brand"].apply(lambda x: str(x).lower()).unique().tolist()

keywords1.extend(["like", "new", "work", "good","phone", "arrived", "iphone", "one", "seller", "love", "buy", "work", "back","fully", "advertised", "sent", "first", "one", "got"
                  , "really", "came", "however", "device", "great", "going", "use", "look", "problem", "go", "note", "·", "get", "see", "need", "still", "want",
                  "even", "also", "much", "i've", "seem", "two", "mate","10", "2", "better", "way", "issue", "pro", "day", "way", "issue", "galaxy", "never", "3"            
                  ])

lemma = WordNetLemmatizer()
def clean_text(text):
    # Convert the text into lowercase
    text = str(text).lower()
    # Split into list
    wordList = text.split()
    # Remove punctuation
    wordList = ["".join(x for x in word if (x=="'")|(x not in punc)) for word in wordList]
    # Remove stopwords
    wordList = [word for word in wordList if word not in stop]
    # Remove other keywords
    wordList = [word for word in wordList if word not in keywords1]
    # Lemmatisation
    wordList = [lemma.lemmatize(word) for word in wordList]
    return " ".join(wordList)


# Calculate the word frequency
def word_freq_dict(text):
    # Convert text into word list
    wordList = str(text).split()
    # Generate word freq dictionary
    wordFreqDict = {word: wordList.count(word) for word in wordList}
    return wordFreqDict

```
### Printing the result and calling the functions above
The last function was a function to create the list of the most common keywords, either good or bad ones, and a summary of what people have written about this under each keyword. Before implementing this function I tried out many extractive summary algorithms but in my case, the ones that worked the best were KL-sum and LexRank. These gave very good summaries but were pretty different. This is because they work in totally different ways, in short one can say that LexRank is a type of Graph-based algorithm that is based on the page rank algorithm. KL-sum, on the other hand, is an algorithm that tries to create a summary with as small KL-divergence as possible, in this case, the KL-divergence is the difference between the unigram distribution of the text and the summary. Down below is the code for the function when KL-sum is used. The only difference when using LexRank is that KL-sum is changed to LexRank in the code. This is because I use the sumy library, which contains a lot of different summarizing algorithms.

```python
def write_out_list(text):
    x=word_freq_dict(clean_text(text))
    important_keywords = dict(sorted(x.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)[:5])
    
    for x in range(5):
        important_txt=[sentence + '.' for sentence in str(text).lower().split('.') if list(important_keywords)[x] in sentence]
        my_parser = PlaintextParser.from_string(important_txt,Tokenizer('english'))
        kl_summarizer=KLSummarizer()
        kl_summary=kl_summarizer(my_parser.document,sentences_count=3)
        print ("\n -" + list(important_keywords)[x]+ ":\n")
        for sentence in kl_summary:
            print(sentence)

```

To write out the PROS and CONS for the choosen phone the write_out_list function was called for both the positive and negative reviews.
```python
print("\n PROS and CONS of " + reviews[0:1]["title_y"].to_string())
print("---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n")
text=pos_out
print("\n PROS:")
write_out_list(text)
print("----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n")
text=neg_out
print("\n CONS:")
write_out_list(text)
```
### the result
This resulted in the following PROS & CONS list for the searched phone, in this case the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+

### Reflection
I think this project was very fun and interesting, it gave me a good insight into different machine learning techniques, summarizing algorithms and I got to learn how to write python code. I think that this project could be improved and more parts of machine learning could be added. One example is to add sentiment analysis, by adding that many more reviews could be added and the program would not be dependent on ratings from the reviews. Another thing that could be improved is the search word classification, this function would need to be improved and rewritten if it was implemented on a website or app. The list of keywords that are not important could also be improved, it would be exciting to see if the program could learn over time which keywords are overall important and not, from supervised learning. This could perhaps be done with a summarizing algorithm like lexrank which can handle multi-document and redundancy in a good way. The biggest problem I encountered in this project was that people can write pretty much anything when reviewing, this resulted in a lot of weird summaries in the beginning. The helpful votes on Amazon helped a lot, with this feature the absolute worst reviews could be filtered out. It would be interesting to implement the code in an app or website, I think that with some improvements the code could be helpful in some areas. I think that if you scrape the data directly from somewhere rather than having a stored dataset, it would make the code much more adaptable and the implementation on a website would be much easier. Some other improvements would be: include some reviews from professionals, and maybe weigh these reviews a bit heavier. A counter for how often a certain keyword was mentioned in different reviews could be useful, since this would show if it is a common problem, but also how common it is compared to the other pros/cons. The last thing that would be cool to implement is to use abstractive summarizations instead of extractive ones, this would make the program create summaries with its own words.


### Some insight about the summarization:
To see an example of how much text is summarized in the last step, I inserted a text at the bottom of the page. The text can look very random and doesn't make much sense when reading it as a document. This is because it is the merged text containing the "best" positive reviews for the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+. The program creates two texts like this, one for the positive reviews and one for the negative reviews. This gives a view of how much text that you would need to read if you didn't look at the PROS&CONS list and this is only the most useful review. If no reviews are filtered out, you would have to read an ocean of reviews and a lot of gibberish and nonsense. Down below is what the pros list looks like that the long text at the bottom is turned into.

### Information about the project
The project was done as a part of the course TNM108 by me, Edwin Friberg, while writing this I study my fourth year in Electronc Design Enginering at LiU. 


### The pro_out text used to create the pros list
This is what the text looked like for all the positive reviews after the worst reviews had been filtered out. This is the text named pos_out in the code, that the last function is used on, it is then summarized and transformed into the pros list above.
pro_out:

>Compact design, almost bezeless display, feels extremely solid, and the design is purely top notch. Nothing else out there as of 2019. · The AMOLED display looks fantastic. I found it a joy when watching or reading anything from this screen. · I found the fingerprint reader to be very sensitive and quick. · The Aura Glow is something I honestly thought I would hate. But this rainbow effect is a beautiful look because you don’t see a rainbow but, depending on the angle of the phone, you only see one color. Look from a different angle I get a different color. Very creative and something new in a world of black and white phones. · The video editor is super easy to trim and add music to your clips. I did see that it does work with Adobe Premiere Rush, so that’s a big smile for all your move makers on the go. I will also say, using the pen is a lifesaver when you’re trying to trim seconds of a clip on a smartphone. · For a phone like this, battery life is very good. From 0-100% it only took an hour, and as an average phone user, a full day charge, with the 25-watt charging they provided, will bring my phone around 20% battery life left. Samsung has a 45 W charger than can cut the time in half of the charging, but you need to pay extra for that one. Still impressive. · The S Pen is shorter and thinner than it looks in person. · The Pen does an excellent job of converting my weak handwriting into a text. All you have to do is write your note, tap the text area, and press an onscreen “Convert” button. For English grammar, it worked flawlessly for me. I see the use of this feature if you need to take a quick note asap. · You can sync the Note 10 to your windows desktop (Dex mode). I haven’t tested this feature out, as you’ll need a USB-C to USB-C, but I do love that you have a mini laptop hard drive in your pocket. Just connect it to a computer and the phone will mirror its screen on to your monitor. I can see this super useful if you need to do presentations at work. Just put the PowerPoint file in your phone and connect it to your computer at work. · Another cool feature in the video making world for this phone is the “zoom-in mic” feature. If you don’t have an extension microphone, the phone will use the mics that it has, but not at the same time. When recording, it will the mics on the front of the phone to record your voice, making it clearer. And if you zoom in the mic sensitivity will increase, like having a boom mic. I didn’t test this fully as you’ll need to spend some time comparing this feature, but from basic video playback, the mics are spot on. Samsung is putting up its gain for anyone who wants to film. · Taking photos or videos in very difficult places, the S pen will be your best friend. You can begin filming, or taking, shots, by just clicking on the S pen. It’s a small feature, but I believe is one of the most useful to have. · The stabilization is excellent. I was just walking while filming, and it looks like the phone was on a wire. This is the best stabilization I’ve seen on a phone so far. Well done Samsung. · You have revers charging with this phone, which will, of course, kill your battery. But still, cool to have. · The AR Doodle feature is really cute if your taking photos with friends. I took a picture of just random people and this feature allows me to draw anywhere on the pic without destroying it. Using the pen, making hats and mustaches can make even boring pictures funny. · The Live Focus mode main function is to let you blur out the background. I did like this a lot because you can just block anyone in the background that doesn’t fit your “perfect” picture. It does work well if your object is focused before taking your shot. · The cameras are…well…there just great. Sharp, colorful, ultra-wide provides the same color profile/quality as close up zoom. The details that these cameras can provide is beyond words. I have nothing to say on the overall outcome a smartphone camera like this. It’s the top of the class until Google’s Pixel comes into play. · The sound is also great. It doesn’t come to any specific location, but rather throughout the phone. Samsung built the volume deep in the phone so it can go everywhere, are you will never cover it with your hands. Loud and crisp (no base though). · Playing games like Alto’s Odyssey had no issues other than getting noticeably warm after 40 minutes, which makes sense for that power. Also thanks to the support of UFS 3.0 specification, you’re going to get faster loading times (This was hard to test how much of an impact it has on the phones day-to-day activities, but all I can say is that I had little to none loading time). Cons and Oks:__________ · It’s the end. No more headphone jack. Bringing so much joy and now Samsung’s closest ally has let it go. · The night mode is good, but it’s still nowhere compared to phones like Google. Samsung has yet to master the night mode shots as their system is to up the ISO and slow the shutter speed. They did up there game, but it’s still not enough to get great night shots. I’m overall getting a busy shot and using the telephoto and ultra-wide lenses are both useless at night. · No microSD card slot on the Note 10. · The ultra-wide sometimes creates a fisheye effect. You will see this effect more if there are some bright/mixed colors at the end of your pictures (like a tree or a building with windows). I did notice that I got a slight bend at the way end of my pictures, which makes the image look weird. The solution I found was just to crop the image. I hope software updates will fix this. · With a group of people walking in the background, there were times that the phone had a hard time trying to get focused on the person I was taking. This happens when trying to use the regular and telephoto lenses. · The telephoto lenses tend to over sharpen my images. Taking a close pic of a rose I saw this issue come up. Now for a regular person, this is no issue at all, but for a photographers eye, you’ll see this. · Be warned, get a case. An all-glass design makes writing with the pen a slippery task. I felt more concern holding the phone than what I was writing, so I knew this a must-have case. · You can only write short notes with the pen. I notice that you can’t even write a full sentence on a single line if you wanted the phone to convert your writing into a text. · 45-watt charger cost extra. · The front-facing camera is…well, it’s a front-facing camera. Nowhere near as good as the back, but good enough for having meetings. · Samsung’s keyboard is horrible to use. If you get this download Gboard, it’s the best in smartphone keyboards. · The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor is fast, but even the tiniest dirt on your finger, it makes the process a little slower. Nothing really impressive on this if your hands are sweaty or dirty. · I hate the fact that you have to go to your notifications to shut down the phone. Holding the power button activated Bixby, you can change this if you want. To be honest, Bixby isn’t the best around, so I’ll always change it. · The S pen Air Actions are a neat little tool to use, but I saw more as an accessory than a tool. I didn’t feel the need to use this feature, but it does work. It also does take some practice to get the hang of it but it’s irrelevant for the day to day use. · The battery drains at a pretty consistent rate. The beauty of the device is the screen, but it’s the most that kills the battery. · Every single space on this phone is a fingerprint magnet. · This phone does have a little more weight than your average smartphone. Bottom Line:__________ Samsung is putting the stops in making this a phone for filming. With an almost bezel-less display, an excellent video editing program, and a great battery life, the theory is supported. I admire the premium layout of this phone as the S-pen is very fun to use (but not yet a priority in daily use), the screen is just beautiful, and the system as a whole is excellent. There are some issues with the cameras on this phone, like the “night mode” inaccurate pictures, and I also wish they moved the front-facing camera to the side like before (even though the little black camera is small, it’s still noticeable.). But the honest truth is that I really have nothing super negative about it. Some small issues are there, but I know software updates will fix these problems, or at least I hope they can. Overall: A phone enjoyed for everyone, but built for those who want to film. Hope I was a help to you. Love, Honest Reviewer 64438 First off, let me say this is the 5th Note I have owned (2,4,8 and 9 previously). I was horrified at the price ($1200), but the pre-order freebies took a little of the sting away. I can honestly say that besides the camera, there was little to no difference between the Note 8 and Note 9, and not REALLY worth the upgrade given the price.....The Note 10 on the other hand is a different story...it's worth upgrading from ANY previous note. I've had the phone 4 days so far, and amazed at how quickly it charges with the included 25W charger. After setting it up, transferring files and playing with it for a few hours, I was able to go from 56% to 100% in 23 mins with the fast charger. Battery life is better than my Note 9... I use my phone a lot, but am not on it all day, and haven't seen it dip below 70% so far (except for initial setup which is battery intensive). General speed of the phone is much snappier than my Note 9. All I can say is that it feels more "fluid" than any other phone I've owned to date. Gallery is lightning fast generating thumbnails and playing videos/viewing pictures....even from the SD card. Sound seems to be louder than with the Note 9. Camera takes AWESOME video and stills. Many new camera features I have not explored yet. Size of the Note 10+ is noticeably larger than the 9. Which is great, for me at least. I have not tried out the fingerprint sensor yet, and when I do, will probably still stick with the facial recognition unlock...it's just so fast and effortless, I can't see adding the extra step of pressing a certain spot of the screen. S-Pen works great, and the "air write" mode is fantastic. Again, many new features I have not explored yet. CONS: PRICE. VERY expensive. I'm not sure how long the promotion will last, but Samsung will give you $600 for a Note 9 trade in, which should be jumped on....getting THIS phone at $600 off with a trade in is a bargain. No old style headphone jack...which is not a con for me, as I have never used headphones with my phone, and if I ever did...I'm sure the included USB-C headphones would work just fine for me. No replaceable battery...a feature not seen with Notes since the Note 4....I wish they would bring it back. You have to pay extra for the even faster 45W charger. Including a 25W charger vs the 45W charger is just a tease... but on the bright side, I read where charging your phone THAT fast greatly reduces the life of the battery. All in all, this phone feels like a major upgrade, where previous models felt like a minor upgrade. This is a QUALITY phone top to bottom. If you are looking to upgrade, all I can say is "pull the trigger". DON'T get wrapped up in opinions on the net about how you should "wait for this phone" or "wait for that one".... I mean there will ALWAYS be newer, better features on EVERY newer model.... so if you are constantly waiting 6 months or a year for the newest "better phone"....you're never gonna have a new phone. LOL As a loyal Note user, this has to be the happiest I've been with a new model in quite awhile. 64277 Waited a long time for a Samsung phone with a Snapdragon 855 (Yes I know the S10, but coming from an S7 want something different). I don't just buy new phones when they come out, I wait until they are much faster and more efficient. Snapdragon 820 14nm chip, 845=10nm, 855=7nm. Pros: AMOLED, Snapdragon 855, 256-512GB Storage, 12GB Ram (Sorry Apple), Wireless AX (aka wifi6) Cons: Weak Charging Detected on Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 @ 80+ percent and will start to discharge your phone while using apps like Google Maps or YouTube. **I used a type A to C USB 3.0 with 56k resistor for charging. Used different QC 3.0 chargers and cables to make sure it was not the accessories. Your finger has to be exactly were the sensor is to unlock the phone. I would prefer it to unlock wherever I place my finger. No Aux (minor, but still useful in my opinion). FYI If you want full charging capabilities of this phone you need a Power Delivery 3.0 with PPS and a USB type c to c "e-marker" cable. **Type c to c does not have a 56k resistors, make sure you get a e-marker cable for USB compliant and safety. To future proof get a USB 3.1 type C to C gen 2. This will support 100w charging and transfer speed of 10Gbps. Not any PD 3.0 Charger will do, you NEED a PD 3.0 with PPS that supports charging @ 10v/4.5a = 45 watts. No the Note 10 Plus will not charge @ 15v/3a standard as of 09/17/2019 (currently none on the market except official, waste of money unless you want to charge from 0-100 in ~30-40min). Once you go OLED screen it is difficult to go back to TN or IPS LCDs. Just make sure you don't set your phone to stay idle for a long time before it unlocks because OLEDs can "burn in" similar to plasma tvs. Wireless AX is the new wireless N, better speed and range. AC is speed only, no range. To Samsung I am not sure it is hardware, but if it is software. Please give us a firmware update that allows standard fast charging voltages. 64454 The Note 10+ may be the best phone ever... and not for the reasons you think! The Note 10+ has UFS 3.0, a first for Samsung and this thing flies! Universal Flash Storage 3 is not only over 2 times the old standard (2.1=1200 MB/s vs 3.0=2900 MB/s) but it also has lower power consumption. So far app and game launches are blazing fast. Time will tell, but with these whopping storage options, 12GB of Ram and 4300mAh battery, this beast is going to keep going and going! And when you need to charge it, Fast Charge has you covered. HOWEVER, for even faster charging, get a super amped USB-C charger (87w/90w). I’ve got one for my laptop (ordered from Zon) and it feeds the Sammy 10+ faster than the included adapter. When my Note was at 75%, the Samsung stock adapter showed 41 minutes to full charge. When I hooked it up to my USB-C brick charger, it stated 36 minutes but was done in 33! (I was not using the phone at the time). So if you want faster you can get it. Wireless charging worked great, with and without a few cases I tested, along with my magnetic chip insert, it didn’t get in the way. In the box: -Phone -USB-C Charger with 3ft cable -USB-C AKG Headset (sounds fab, rubber like cords near ear and mic, soft braided cord going into the phone) -Extra Ear nubs (S/M/L) -Some documents which in the picture you will find a key one... The Note 10+ Unlocked comes with a screen protector! What a great surprise. It’s always a challenge getting good EDGE coverage on a 3rd party glass or skin. This one is tight. I wouldn’t have known right away had it not included the paper telling me so. I’ve included some pics (with some dust to show contrast hah). Over the top couldn’t be happier with the phone so far. You have camera and fingerprint sensor embedded in the screen as advertised, but also a hidden top speaker. With the bottom and top speakers going the phone presents quite well. Be sure to turn on Dolby Atmos in the toggle section right away to get the hidden speaker to perform even better. I’ll post in comments if I have any more revelations (or insight to testing DEX software integration) or if you have questions, something you want me to check out, let me know! 64274 12/21/2019 Update - i have only had this for three months now and feel i did make the right decision on getting this model. it enables me to do so much more than any phone i have had before. my hope that i would be able to use this phone in place of my pc for many tasks has worked out better than i'd hoped for. the time i spend working on the computer has easily dropped by half. this really is a great phone in so many respects. Before purchasing this phone the first thing I did was read through and watch a number of reviews for this phone from tech sources, zines, etc. Due to the cost of this item I did a lot more research going into it than I would for most other purchases. I wanted a phone that was well made, would last, could link up easily with my pc or even take its place for many functions especially camera and video. I got all this and more out of this phone! No wonder it is referred to as the 'swiss army knife' for smart phones. Should also note i wasn't surprised to see that every online review of the top android phones for the year had this phone rated #1. Design is fantastic! It looks even better in hand than in photos. Consequently there is no mistaking this phone for others. The screen has lightly slopped or curved edges which complete the near bezel-less design. It is as close to an all display screen phone as I could find. The structure is solid aluminum with no flex whatsoever. Gorilla glass all around and water resistant beyond what most phones are. This can supposedly be submerged in feet of water for many minutes without issue. Overall quality is as good as I expected. It is as close to a perfectly designed phone as I could find at this time. The screen is the largest you can get currently in the U.S. It is large enough for someone like myself with vision problems to see clearly, but not so big as to feel over-sized. See my attached photo of different phones side by side. The resolution and colors are jaw dropping good. I can see details in google earth on my phone zoomed in that I cannot see even when using my pc on a 65” 4K screen. That degree of improvement really surprised me. You can adjust the screen resolution from 1080P to 4K UHD+. When researching this phone I saw several ding the phone for having a 60Hz refresh rate and not higher? While higher refresh rates can be nice for gaming otherwise I am very happy with how snappy the screen is to respond as is. All in all I love every aspect of the display. The camera is arguable the best you can get when combined with the stock photo and video editing apps. Be it wide, telephoto, you name it this phone has it. The weakest area here is night photography. Currently there are a couple other flagship phones that do night shots better. That said when it comes to daytime shots those others don’t fare nearly so well. There is so much you can do, customize when it comes to taking photos and vids that words just fail. None of that matters if you don’t have enough space to store your media. With this I have no worries with the base 256GB of storage coupled with an SD card I have 758GB currently on my phone! They killed off the headphone jack! Yep it’s gone on the note10+ but not the note10? Lots of excuses as to why but real reason is they want you to buy their Samsung buds. I tried a generic brand dongle for my wired earbuds and it failed miserably. I then tried the Samsung version and got very good audio quality. IMHO that absolutely should’ve been included with the phone. Currently I’m using both my Bose QC20’s which are wired and a pair of wireless Amazon buds. They both sound excellent, no complaints whatsoever for audio quality. I still want the audio jack back though. Battery life and charging are the best I have ever had. Comes with a 28 watt charger that will take me from 80-100% in about 11 minutes. Even after a hard day’s use I have yet to dip below 50%. From my research it states and others have confirmed a 0-100% charge time of one hour. Unless you travel a lot, live in airports I don’t see the need for the $50 optional charger that won't do much more IMHO. The battery is the largest capacity I could get in a phone here and was also a factor in my purchase. It has never once gotten hot to the touch. Only a couple times has it gotten slightly warm and that was when I had it charging while using as a video monitor at the same time. It has the fastest wireless charging rate of any Samsung phone at 15W. The smaller note10 is 10W and the smaller of the Galaxy Note series is 5W for comparison. You can also do reverse charging, one of two currently made phones that can do that. Keep in mind doing so you get a slow charge but it works if ever needed. You get an 855 processor, vapor chamber cooling, base 256 GB of memory and 8 GB of ram. You also have expandable storage making it a true storage monster. As said great for anyone taking photos or vids. With all that underneath the hood you can truly multitask. Open as many apps as you want, I’ve never slowed it down one bit. It has enough horses to work easily with its system to connect to pc’s. There you can use your phone through your pc. You can grab and drag pics or files from one to another. All my office apps work on it. I should make some mention of the S Pen. It is great for doing any work on the phone. It enables precise work. Be it photo editing or just clicking on a box on a website, it absolutely improves the entire experience. You can do other things with but my take those are kind of gimmicky. The software, apps are very impressive. Coming off a near stock android experience it took me a bit to get comfortable with OneUI 1.0 meshed with android 9 but now I love it. I have already had several updates with OneUI 1.5 now on my phone. Android 10 has already gone out to some with the rest of us by years end. But back to the custom software, there are so many many things and ways to customize this phone to fit your specific wants and needs I cannot say enough good. Things like being able to set a safe location so your phone doesn’t lock at home. Similarly set it up so it’s safe when connected to a Bluetooth device, for me I set our vehicles as that so they don’t lock inside. My favorite of all is the Edge lighting. That takes the place of the old flashing LED notification light. Edge lighting is what you want from it. Set which apps you want to use with it besides calls. Get a text message the led show is on or not you customize it all. Colors, how it displays, where, how long, how wide. It not only looks amazing but it is much more visible than just one lonely LED light. You can even minimize it to just go around the camera punch hole. Security via pin, pic or sonar sensor. Samsung pay which unlike google pay will work on old stripe type machines. So you can use the Samsung pay feature in spots you’d never think you could. Seriously there are so many ways to customize the software I am still learning new things even now. Things I didn’t like, no 3.5mm audio jack made worse by no included dongle. The phone is beautiful to look at but the thing is slippery as all get out to hold onto thanks to being all glass. I put a case on the back immediately for just that reason. I don’t like having Samsung pay on the bottom to activate with a swipe up. Problem is if you have gestures enabled half the time instead of going to your home screen, especially if locked, you end up opening the pay app instead. S Pen gimmicks to me are a waste. My edge lighting didn’t work at first. I ended up having to get the edge lighting fix and edge lighting plus from the galaxy store (free). Point being it should have worked straight out of the box but minor gripe. They put a screensaver on at the factory, unlike any phone I’ve had before, and didn’t mention anywhere in the docs or packaging it was there. So I thought it was just another piece of the many protective clear plastic stickies you remove when unboxing, it wasn’t. They fixed that self-inflicted issue on the Samsung fold but not with the Note10+? Minor gripes aside this is the best, most capable phone I’ve ever owned. It is one of the rare phones out that truly allows you to supplement many things before you could only do on a PC. The extra screen size is not wasted. I don’t notice the camera cutout and that extra size makes it much easier to use with my poor vision. This phone is one I really can do work on without difficulty. I love the screen, the look, the hardware, the imaging setup. I would recommend this phone to anyone at this time based on my personal experience with it even at this price point. It does so much and is built so well. I fully expect it to stand up to the test of time. **FYI - The Note line is merging with the Galaxy S series to be formally announced 2/2020 along with a massive bump in the camera sensor size. 64271 This phone is great! Very beautiful. The shipping was fast except i had to bug down DHL cause they keep delaying custom and wont notify or tell you why. No scratches or glitches that I can see so far. Came with plastic screen protector, definitely need to get a case. Pretty happy :) 64269 I purchased this phone because my old Galaxy S7 finally bit the dust. I have in fact purchased phones for my parents the Note 8 and Note 9 and I have seen how impressive they were and how well they performed. This one is a de facto evolution to those phones. It takes awesome pictures, it is buttery smooth in terms of speed, the pen features improved (however, it is smaller). Everyone is jealous because of the screen size and capabilities. The only downside to the phone is the fact it is north of $1000 pushing towards the $1500 once you get the 512 GB Storage, the 512GB SD Card, Insurance and an OtterBox Defender! As a consolation prize, Amazon was cool to throw in one of those nifty 2nd Gen Echo Plus that was tied into it as a promotion. Nobody came close as a promo item. 64267 Slightly concerned as the box had been opened before getting to me. The phone seems to be new from everything I can tell, but that took some of my excitement away...not knowing for sure if someone had handled the phone prior to me. The sticker that is usually on the back of the phone was not present...you could see where it had been. The phone is quite nice, although not sure it's worth 1200 bucks. The camera is not really what the YouTube reviewers say it is...it does a lot of softening to faces...even with beauty mode turned off. Not sure if I'm keeping the phone after all of the above...still deciding. 64266 I'll keep this short, phone is great and all but moving from the Rog phone to this one is super hard, and this is mainly because the refresh rate 120 back to 60 is actually kind of straining on the eyes now ( eyes are kind of sensitive). Besides this everything else is great, oh and if you don't like the hole punch in the middle because of video watching there is like this semi full screen mode that just black bars the side and it's great, but 60hz on a $1200 phone hurts the soul. 64270 The Note 10+ is like that one popular kid everyone knows at school. It has many cool features, no headphone jack, but it just had the best looks. Buy the Note 10+, iPhones are overpriced. 64264 My New Note 10+ arrived Tuesday Morning. Having Owned The Note 1, Note 2, Note 4, Note 7 (for a few hours before it was recalled), and the Note 8, I had more than a few expectations. After 6 days of ownership, i can honestly say every expectation was meet or exceeded. Battery Life unbelievable. Screen excellent. Included software, great. Have used it on both Verizon & AT&T with no problems. Not expecting any problems in Europe in a few weeks, in multiple countries, with 2 more service provider's SIMs With 512GB built in, and my installed 512GB Micro SD Card, I can carry with me every document, every picture, every video that i want to not only for areas without or high priced Wi-Fi, but also as a secure backup for my small business files. So Why am I sorry? I am sorry for the external battery sellers - I don't need to carry one with me. Sorry that I have purchased multiple QC3 vehicle chargers. Don't need most of them. Almost sorry I have 3 tablets, 2 at offices, 1 at home. Have not quite given those up, but they may end up for sale. Is the phone overpriced? Of course it is, however it is something I use virtually every waking hour. Extremely pleased with it! 64263 SMARTPHONE INTRO I've been buying the latest and greats smartphones since the early HTC days and have owned just about every significant Samsung smartphone release since then. Every year I will stray over to other manufacturers to see what the big and small players are up to. Most, but not all of the time, I find myself right back to my Samsung phone as the daily driver. Which is usually a Note. Now that Samsung has released another Note series for an increasingly high price, let's see how it does. In particular against my Note 9 that it's replacing. PROS: + Excellent build quality + The high-resolution OLED display somehow looks even better than before + Superfast performance; zero lag + Much improved speakers that you can *feel* + The bezels continue to disappear; nearly all-screen + Core functions, such as phone calls, still work great + Lots of internal storage + expandable storage + Generous battery that truely lasts all-day + Fast wired and wireless charging for those very heavy phone usage days + The ever-useful stylus continues to evolve + 3 Camera Lenses for any scenario + Great picture & video quality with some useful features CONS: - Hole punch camera is distracting - The in-screen fingerprint reader takes a few steps back from the physical sensor - RIP headphone jack - Price keeps going up DESIGN Compared to the Galaxy Note 9, the Galaxy Note 10+ feels much more substantial than I expected. It has more heft and somehow even more solid feel to it. In particular with the Samsung OEM cases. Which are also expensive, but continue the high-quality impression of what you are holding in the hand. The left side has the volume up/down and power button. The bottom is USB-C port and stylus holder. The rest of the phone is fairly clean and simple. I prefer power on the right, but it's easy enough to get used to after a few hours. I opted for the white version to mix things up and I like it. It still provides a nice high-end look all while resisting visible fingerprints (and probably scratches) than most darker and shinier colors. Even with a 6.8" display, it's still roughly the same size as the Note 9. There is now simply less bezel. But due to the squared corners, it never feels small. If you aren't already used to large phones, this will take some getting used to. And as manufacturers continue to slowly push the size of phones combined with no more bezels to shrink, this is probably about as large as I expect a mainstream phone to go. Any further and folks are going to have issues. SOFTWARE Long ago this used to be Samsung's weakest point. They'd throw lots of half-baked features with no optimization, resulting in lots of lag and bloat. Those days are long gone. Samsung nailed that down with the Galaxy S9/Note 9 series. Except with the Note 10, it's even faster, and smoother. Which I suspect much credit goes toward the Snapdragon 855. I should note that I am a fan of Google's Android Experience. But every time I jump over to a Google phone (or another brand), I immediately start to miss all of the small but very useful features Samsung has built into their phone. The game launcher, scene optimizer, multiple lenses, display quality, high-end specs, etc. And honestly, after easily disabling Bixby, there isn't that much bloat. Disable/Remove a few random apps like Facebook and I'm good to go. PERFORMANCE As noted above, the performance is absolutely fantastic. Usually while going through initial setup or installing apps, these phones tend to get very laggy. This was probably the only time I saw a hint of lag, but surprisingly minimal. In that, I could easily and quickly perform other tasks while downloading and installing apps, games, music, etc. Each year as performance increases, the need for synthetic benchmarks decrease. I think they still serve a purpose in limited use-cases for a "reliable" baseline. But today, I'm not going to bother. This phone is fast and can do everything you want. DISPLAY & AUDIO The 6.8" WQHD+ Dynamic AMOLED display combined with some significantly improved speakers are simply the best upgrades from previous phones. Watching high-resolution content on YouTube or Netflix look and sound fantastic. I found myself glued to the screen during my demo session with various clips. Even the icons on the desktop almost pop from the screen. As though they are right there touching your fingers. The speakers finally have some force behind them as well. Allowing you to "feel" the vibrations in your hand. And yes, they are quite loud. With Atmos-enabled they provide a great stereo separation effect. I'll also mention there is an included screen protected. It's very thin but it's quite unobtrusive. I usually remove these. But since it virtually covers the entire screen and provides a smooth swiping experience, I'll leave it for now. And last I'll briefly mention the hole punch as it does have a negative impact with the multimedia experience. Anytime there is a bright scene around that area, my eyes are immediately drawn to it. This needs go away sooner rather than later. CAMERAS As the camera count increases, so too does the usefulness, functionality, and flexibility. The rear now has a 16MB ultra-wide camera, 12MP wide-angle camera (normal), and 12MP telephoto camera. The introduction of wide-angle is super useful and one I use very often. Each camera captures excellent pictures. I told my Pixel 3 and don't have it for comparison today. Are there better cameras available? I'm sure there are. But unless you are really comparing back-to-back, I doubt you'd notice. In particular, if you like to record video. That's one area the Pixel and some other phones don't do as well. The stability and clarity when recording 4K @ 60fp is excellent. Combined with solid audio recording and you've got a great overall camera package. I'm not into selfies, but that 10MP camera is somewhat mandatory these days. It's unfortunate it has resulted in a small but very noticeable hole in the screen. Which as noted above, is absolutely noticeable. In either case, it takes solid pictures as well. No complaints there. FINGERPRINT READER Unfortunately, there is another negative feature change. With the Galaxy Note 9, and virtually every other phone with a physical reader, you can just rest your finger and quickly unlock/wake your phone. With Samsung's implementation of the in-screen reader, you have to press firmly and wait a second for it to register. And if it doesn't read your fingerprint right away, it may be a few seconds or repeated attempts. If the screen is turned on, it does tend to be quicker. But you still need to press firmly and wait longer than in the past. I'm really hoping a software update improves this. Otherwise, I may just go back to the power button and a pin. DEX & "YOUR PHONE" There are a lot of other software features, but I did want to highlight these two as they are unique and stand out for me. I got used to Dex with my last Samsung phone. And there continue to be minor but useful improvements. Dex is surprisingly useful if you want to do some light work. When I'm on-the-go I can easily plug in a USB-C to HDMI cable, Bluetooth keyboard/mouse and have a portable desktop experience. You can also now use a normal USB cable and windows app to access Dex, it's just not ideal for games and multimedia. I've got personal and work e-mail, browser, youtube, office apps, and a range of other tools. I don't need to do video or photo editing on the go. And I found this can meet just about any task I need or want to do while traveling. This is a little more useful on a tablet, but in a different way, as the keyboard is already included. Less to travel with. And then there is the new Your Phone feature. This is a little more "early stage" in development, but still handy. Just plug in a USB cable to any Windows PC and you can mirror what's on your phone. You also have direct access to messages, but the mirror function is nice. You can interact with your phone, on the PC. All while charging it. I'd like to see more dedicated ports into this app. But being able to see and respond to any notification is great. Just don't expect to play games or smoothly stream youtube. THE PHONE That's right, this is still a phone. And as such, it needs to make phone calls! And other core functions. As I use this for both personal and work, this is a critical but often overlooked feature. While it may feel like more of a check-box item, I've had more than a few phones over the years that still fail in this arena. I'm pleased to report that phone calls and text are excellent. Speakerphone works well. No issues with hearing anybody and vice versa. The radios appear to be good quality. Bluetooth is reliable as well as wi-fi, which is very fast. I'm easily pushing 300-400Mbps up/down with my Google Mesh Wireless network. CONCLUSION So how exactly do you justify a $1,100 phone? Honestly, you really don't justify it. At least not in the traditional sense. My Note 9 would have continued to serve me well for another year. But we buy these phones because they're interesting, they entertain us, and they make life a little bit easier. And considering the significant percentage of time many of us spend on these portable gadgets, it starts to make sense that we want to allocate more budget towards them. While it's not perfect (no phone is), I still believe Samsung has enough features, functionality, quality, and performance for me to "justify" the Galaxy Note 10+'s price and keep it as my daily driver for another year. I'll still grab a few more phones that intrigue me between now and the Note 11, but I'd be surprised if they truly replaced this one. If they can, I'd welcome it.
